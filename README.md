# CIFAR-10 CNN: A Project on Diagnosing and Fixing Overfitting

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The primary goal is to illustrate the process of identifying model overfitting and implementing advanced techniques to build a more robust, generalizable model.

## Project Narrative

The project follows a clear experimental process:
1.  **Baseline Model**: A simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built and trained. Analysis of its training history revealed significant overfitting, where the model performed well on training data but poorly on validation data.
2.  **Optimized Model**: A second model was built with several regularization techniques to combat overfitting:
    - **Batch Normalization**: To stabilize and speed up training.
    - **Dropout**: To prevent neurons from co-adapting and force the model to learn more robust features.
    - **Advanced Callbacks**: `EarlyStopping` was used to prevent the model from training unnecessarily long, and `ReduceLROnPlateau` was used to adjust the learning rate for finer tuning.
3.  **Comparison**: The performance of both models was compared side-by-side, clearly demonstrating that the optimized model achieved better validation accuracy and successfully mitigated overfitting.

## Final Results

- **Baseline Model Accuracy**: [Enter your base model's test accuracy here]%
- **Optimized Model Accuracy**: [Enter your optimized model's test accuracy here]%

The comparison plots clearly show a reduced gap between training and validation metrics for the optimized model, confirming its superior generalization capabilities.
